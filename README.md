  # Introduction
## Project Objective 
This project aims to develop an optimized pit stop strategy for Formula 1, to improve final 
position. Pit stops are crucial race moments where cars receive quick servicing, such as tire 
changes or mechanical fixes. Our focus is on enhancing pit stop efficiency to improve race 
outcomes. 
## Motivation 
With 10 teams operate under different budgets, Formula 1 is not always a level playing field. 
Our model aims to bridge these gaps by providing tailored pit stop strategies. Mercedes 
already uses AI for race strategy, proving the potential of such models. Additionally, 
broadcasters and fans can gain valuable insights into pit stop decisions. 
## Previous Work 
We build on prior research, particularly Fatima et al. (2023), who introduced Deep-Racing, 
the first motorsports Embedded Deep Neural Network (EDNN) for predicting driver rankings 
and optimal pit stops. We adopted their approach of categorizing data into distinct types and 
embedding each section accordingly, starting from their architecture and adapting it to our 
specific objectives. 
## Strategy  
Pit stop strategy depends on various factors like tire wear, compound selection, and race 
events (e.g., safety car interventions after accidents). Since some variables like mechanical 
issues are unpredictable, we focus on tire-related strategies, analysing: 
1. The number of pit stops per race 
2. The tire compounds used 
3. The laps on which pit stops occur  
This approach aims to achieve a targeted and effective pit stop strategy model.
